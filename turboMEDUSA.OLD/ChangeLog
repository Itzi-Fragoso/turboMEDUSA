2011-12-12
  * re-implemented 'mixed' models
  * added cutAtStem option; TRUE, FALSE, or "both"

2011-10-09
  * fixed bug in runMultiMEDUSA

2011-08-02
  * fixed threshold correction for small trees (set to zero)
  * updated documentation; added "mixed" model description to help
  * renamed "summarize.turboMEDUSA" to "summarizeTurboMEDUSA" for consistency
  * added function "plotPrettyTree"
	- "summarizeTurboMEDUSA" now returns "treeParameters" for this plotting

2011-08-01
  * added more error-checking to function "prune.tree.merge.data"

2011-07-28
  * fixed bug in function "prune.tree.merge.data"
	- if length(phy$tip.label) == length(richness[,1]), assumed fine (i.e. no pruning)
	- however, this is a problem if a typo is present
	- function now checks this

2011-06-07
  * fixed bug in "summarize.turboMEDUSA"
	- same typo in termination condition below

2011-06-05
  * added Yule model as a user choice
	- eventually allow mixed models (mix of BD and Yule processes)

2011-05-26
  * fixed bug with threshold criterion (identified by Gavin Thomas)
	- typo in termination condition

2011-05-24
  * cleaned up utility functions and put into "turboMEDUSA-utilities.R"
	- added documentation (internal to file only)
  * uploaded to GitHub

2011-05-23
  * fixed threshold stop criterion
	- if stop="threshold" but number of models hit default then analysis terminated
	- now stop only if maximum model limit is encountered
	- will only arise with very large trees

2011-05-19  
  * created R-package version of original turboMEDUSA script
