1. Implement pure-birth (Yule) model - DONE
  - need to:
     - count parameters better in information theoretic calculations - DONE
        - remove 'NAs' from parameter counts
        - update stopping criterion (more models allowed) - DONE
     - pass model flavour to various functions (get.max.model.limit, make.lik.medusa.part,
       medusa.ml.fit.partition, medusa.ml.initial, medusa.ml.prefit, medusa.ml.update
       calculate.model.fit) - DONE

2. Implement mixed models (mix of BD and Yule processes) - DONE
  - need to:
     - calculate both flavours for both tips and virgin.nodes
        - put results in a common list 'prefit' - DONE
     - calculate both flavours for all splits, select best one for each - DONE
     - perform checks on all downstream functions - DONE
     - update summarizeTurboMEDUSA to consider flavour of model when plotting surfaces - DONE
        - at the moment assume only BD models are to be plotted

3. Implement summary function for a results over a distribution of trees
  - just need to find a efficient way to parse the list of lists

4. Make surface plotting more general - DONE
  - fit plot to relevant region (i.e. not just [0,1] for both r and epsilon) - DONE
  - plots for Yule models - DONE

5. Pass in user fixed epsilon

6. Plot tip richnesses next to tree (needs to consider coordinates)

7. Fix r (b) optimization interval for extreme clades
