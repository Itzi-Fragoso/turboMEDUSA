1. Implement pure-birth (Yule) model - DONE
  - need to:
     - count parameters better in information theoretic calculations - DONE
        - remove 'NAs' from parameter counts
        - update stopping criterion (more models allowed) - DONE
     - pass model flavour to various functions (get.max.model.limit, make.lik.medusa.part,
       medusa.ml.fit.partition, medusa.ml.initial, medusa.ml.prefit, medusa.ml.update
       calculate.model.fit) - DONE

2. Implement mixed models (mix of BD and Yule processes) - DONE
  - need to:
     - calculate both flavours for both tips and virgin.nodes
        - put results in a common list 'prefit' - DONE
     - calculate both flavours for all splits, select best one for each - DONE
     - perform checks on all downstream functions - DONE
     - update summarizeTurboMEDUSA to consider flavour of model when plotting surfaces - DONE
        - at the moment assume only BD models are to be plotted - FIXED

3. Implement summary function for a results over a distribution of trees - DONE
  - just need to find a efficient way to parse the list of lists

4. Make surface plotting more general - DONE
  - fit plot to relevant region (i.e. not just [0,1] for both r and epsilon) - DONE
  - plots for Yule models - DONE

5. Pass in user fixed epsilon - DONE

6. Plot tip richnesses next to tree (needs to consider coordinates) - DONE, but placement a little ugly

7. Fix r (b) optimization interval for extreme clades - DONE

8. Complete documentation
  - especially for multiMedusa functions

9. Alter output such that only the final optimal model is saved to the results - DONE
  - this will require changing summary functions

10. Significant memory problem: intermediate results of lapply over nodes can be several 100s of MB for large trees (e.g. 2000 tips)
  - keep only AICc score and node ID during course of lapply, recalcuate on best node after - DONE

11. Problem with conTree and multiMedusa trees possibly having a different tiplabel ordering
  - reported by Laurie Sorenson (UCLA)
  - multiMedusa trees *should* have same ordering, as likely read in using a single translation table (e.g. BEAST)
    - not sure if this applies to reading in a file (e.g. phylip or nexus) without a translation table
      - CHECK THIS
  - for the first part, try reordering conTree tip labels (since multiMedusa should be fine)

12. Fix crashes due to poor initial starting parameters in some tree distributions - DONE
  - dealt with number of edges vs. total path lengths per partition
