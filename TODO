1. Implement pure-birth (Yule) model - DONE
  - need to:
     - count parameters better in information theoretic calculations
        - remove 'NAs' from parameter counts
        - update stopping criterion (more models allowed)
     - pass model flavour to various functions (get.max.model.limit, make.lik.medusa.part,
       medusa.ml.fit.partition, medusa.ml.initial, medusa.ml.prefit, medusa.ml.update
       calculate.model.fit)

2. Implement mixed models (mix of BD and Yule processes)
  - need to:
     - calculate both flavours for both tips and virgin.nodes
        - put results in a common list 'prefit'
     - calculate both flavours for all splits, select best one for each
     - perform checks on all downstream functions
     - update summarize.turboMEDUSA to consider flavour of model when plotting surfaces
        - at the moment assume only BD models are to be plotted

3. Implement summary function for a results over a distribution of trees
  - just need to find a efficient way to parse the list of lists

4. Make surface plotting more general
  - fit plot to relevant region (i.e. not just [0,1] for both r and epsilon)
  - plots for Yule models?
