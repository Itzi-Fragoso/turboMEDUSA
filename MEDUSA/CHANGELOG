  * added informative error message when zero-length branches encountered

2012-02-01
  * fixed a minor bug and got rid of unix-requirement

2012-01-31
  * made final updates to 'fitSisters' function
  * implemented checks for multicore dependency; stops if Windows or GUI implementation
	- removes necessity for separate Windows version. Yay!

2012-01-13
  * added 'backStep' function which considers removing previously-fit shifts. These may lose significance as more nested shifts are added.

2012-01-11
  * put better bounds on parameter values for 'optimize'; gets rid of annoying (yet as far as I can tell, harmless) warnings

2012-01-05
  * added fixed d and fixed b constrained models

2012-01-04
  * added fixed epsilon and fixed r constrained models

2012-01-03
  * cleaned up documentation

2012-01-02
  * added 95% confidence intervals on parameter estimates via profile likelihoods

2012-01-01
  * added 'preserveModelFlavour' option to mixed models. Default (for now) is TRUE
  * rearranged code for efficiency and readability

2011-12-29
  * added ability to fit individual nodes designated by user
  * whole bunch of speed updates

2011-12-21-29
  * several setbacks dealt with

2011-12-20
  * removed annoying requirement that summary had to be directed to an object

2011-12-19
  * sped up Yule fitting through simplification of equations

2011-12-13
  * updated plotPrettyTree function
  * took out AIC weights, as they are meaningless when using a threshold criterion > 0
	- if desired, can still be calculated using function "calculate.model.weights"
  * fixed precision problem in Yule model when dealing with large trees.

2011-12-12
  * re-implemented 'mixed' models
  * added cutAtStem option; TRUE, FALSE, or 'both'
  * both 'mixed' and 'both' can be used together

2011-10-09
  * fixed bug in runMultiMEDUSA

2011-08-02
  * fixed threshold correction for small trees (set to zero)
  * updated documentation; added "mixed" model description to help
  * renamed "summarize.turboMEDUSA" to "summarizeTurboMEDUSA" for consistency
  * added function "plotPrettyTree"
	- "summarizeTurboMEDUSA" now returns "treeParameters" for this plotting

2011-08-01
  * added more error-checking to function "prune.tree.merge.data"

2011-07-28
  * fixed bug in function "prune.tree.merge.data"
	- if length(phy$tip.label) == length(richness[,1]), assumed fine (i.e. no pruning)
	- however, this is a problem if a typo is present
	- function now checks this

2011-06-07
  * fixed bug in "summarize.turboMEDUSA"
	- same typo in termination condition below

2011-06-05
  * added Yule model as a user choice
	- eventually allow mixed models (mix of BD and Yule processes)

2011-05-26
  * fixed bug with threshold criterion (identified by Gavin Thomas)
	- typo in termination condition

2011-05-24
  * cleaned up utility functions and put into "turboMEDUSA-utilities.R"
	- added documentation (internal to file only)
  * uploaded to GitHub

2011-05-23
  * fixed threshold stop criterion
	- if stop="threshold" but number of models hit default then analysis terminated
	- now stop only if maximum model limit is encountered
	- will only arise with very large trees

2011-05-19  
  * created R-package version of original turboMEDUSA script
