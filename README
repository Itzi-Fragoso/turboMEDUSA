Development version of an R package. 

Will eventually be made available on CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/) in the Geiger package version 2.0.

'Windows' users unfortunately cannot take advantage of multiple core processing via the R package 'multicore', as it does not yet have a Windows-supported version for recent versions of R (it is possible to use an older version of R together with an older version of multicore, I guess). MEDUSA checks this, and ignores multiple core requests is appropriate.
